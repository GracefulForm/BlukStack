# BlukStack
A BookStack clone that can be hosted on shared hosting and is based on Bludit.

### What is Bookstack?
BookStack (https://www.bookstackapp.com/) is a simple, yet amazing, wiki platform that is great for creating books, documentation, wiki's, and any other online information. Unfortunately, BookStack is not designed to be hosted in a shared hosting environment and so is not easy to get or use by a new blogger. We highly recommend BookStack, but if you need something simpler and easier to use and host, we recommend Blukstack.
