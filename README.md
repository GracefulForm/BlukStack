# BlukStack
A BookStack clone that can be hosted on a shared hosting environment and is based on Bludit.

### What is Bookstack?
BookStack (https://www.bookstackapp.com/) is a simple, yet amazing, wiki platform that is great for creating books, documentation, wiki's, and any other online information. Unfortunately, BookStack is not designed to be hosted in a shared hosting environment and so is not easy to get or use by a new blogger. We highly recommend BookStack, but if you need something simpler and easier to use and host, we recommend Blukstack.

### What is Bludit?
Bludit (https://www.bludit.com/) is a beginner friendly flat-file CMS for websites, blogs, and portfolios. It can be hosted on any server, including shared hosting, that support PHP.

### Enter BlukStack
Blukstack is a template for Bludit that includes many great features of BookStack. 

### Version
0.01 (Alpha)

### Roadmap to 1.0
* Create template (based on W3.css)
* Convert to Bludit CMS
* Change language files to match shelves, books, and chapters.
* Documentation / Help
